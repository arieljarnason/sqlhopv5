a) find these dependencies 
b) use them to guide the decomposition of the relations

For each relation, you must determine the following:
1) All the (functional and multi-valued) dependencies represented in the relation (based
on the assumptions above);
2) All the keys of the relation (based on the detected dependencies);
3) The minimal cover of the set of functional dependencies; and
4) The current normal form of the relation.
Then you must decompose the relation until each sub-relation is in either 3NF or BCNF,
as well as in 4NF, while preserving all FDs of the minimal cover.
For each relation resulting from the decomposition, you must determine the same four
items as above.
You must document all these steps and outcomes and write a report. Then you must
create the resulting tables and populate them, by extracting the relevant data from the
original relations.
